# big picture
For this project, I would like to make a video game which is about Pokemons. First of all, what is pokemon? Pokemon is a media franchise managed by The Pok√©mon Company, a Japanese consortium between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. There are different types of pokemons and they can be found in anywhere. As a pokemon trainer, after you catch the pokemons, you an use them to compete with other pokemon trainers. For this game, we as the pokemon trainer will catch pokemons in three room. In each room, you will catch different pokemons. In the first room, the pokemon trainer can catch grass pokemon; in the second room, they can catch fire pokemons; in the the last room, they can catch all different types of pokemons. If the player catch one pokemon successfully, then the player can earn 5 credits. If the player earns 20 credits in room one, then he or she can go to room two. Player in room two can catch fire pokemons. Again, if the player earns 30 credits in room two, then he or she can go to room three. 

# first step
The pokemon trainer should first insert their name. For example : "trainer Joe"

Room 1 : grass pokemons ( 5 points each )

Room 2 : fire pokemons ( 5 points each )

Room 3: all types of pokemons ( if you catch the ghost pokemon then you will lose 5 points)
After the trainer earn 20 points in room 1, then they can go to the second one. In room 2, they also need to earn 20 points then they can go the third room. 

# testing plan
There will have some random pokemons pops out and ask whether you want to catch it or not. 
for example: Do you want to catch Bulbasaur?
if you answer "Yes" then you will receive five credits.
if you anser "no" then it will answer "Ok. Bulbasaur escapes..."
Also, after the trainer catch two pokeons, it will ask " Do you want to know your credit now?"
if you answer yes, then it will tell you your current credits. 

# revision, reflection
There is a main step that I have not finished yet which is the transfer from room 1 to the second room. Also, the plan of the accumulation is different than my original plan. 

# next step 
I am almost finish room 1 for the game. The next step for the game is room 2 and room 3.
